											<h2>GreenMobility Demand Prediction</h2>
											<p><b><i>Using deep convolutional LSTM's to predict future demand</i></b></p>
											<p>The project assesses Convolutional Long Short Term Memory networks for demand prediction of free floating Mobility as a Service fleets. Furthermore, it seeks to model the time and place of a successful car rental by creating a spatiotempo- ral model for near future rentals based on data provided by GreenMobility.
												The primary approach is the Convolutional LSTM. This model is compared to multiple output LSTM and linear regression. The results show that when modeling the demand as the location of the car of successful rentals, the Convolutional LSTM does not yield significantly better results than a linear regression with time-related independent variables.</p>

											<h2>Multi Agent Systems</h2>
											<p><b><i>DTU 02288 Artificial Intelligence and Multiagent Systems</i></b></p>
											<p>The project presents a multi-agent architecture for solving transportation tasks in the simplified hospital domain. 
												The client implements individual problem-solving and communication between agents by the cooperative distributed problem solving framework, where problem decomposition and synthesis are key. 
												When synthesising the sub-problem solutions, eventual conflicts are handled online, and the behavior of agents involved in conflicts is defined by social laws, always favoring the collective solution compared to any individual agent. 
												By performing an extensive level preprocessing, which included locating constructs such as tunnels, wells, and con- nected components, this client was able to solve just under 50% of the submitted levels for the competition. It ranked 3/28 in the multi-agent category</p>

											<h1>Hollywood as a social network</h1>
											<p>The overall idea of this project was to investigate interesting properties of the Hollywood acting environment, and how it has developed over time. We looked at whether Hollywood movies resembles the state of the world, at the moment they are created, and sought answers to the question - Is Hollywood a sign of the times?
												Our goal was that after having read this notebook, one would have gotten an in-depth understanding of Hollywood as a network of actors and as a sign of the times.

											<h2>Algorithms for music indexing</h2>
											<p><b><i>Using and investigating audio search algortihms</i></b></p>
											<p>Given a short recording of a piece of music, the music indexing problem is to identify from a music database, the song that the recording originated from. This project considers different solutions to this problem based on spectrograms. We explore how to identify peak frequencies, filter out noise from these spectrograms and how to store these filtered spectrograms (fingerprints) efficiently such that they can be compared fast. Our primary solution utilises locality sensitive hashing with min hash that seeks to compress the fingerprints into even smaller signatures and quickly be able to identify near-similar signatures by hashing them using the banding technique</p>

The project was implemented in Jupyter Notebooks using the <a href="https://pystan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">PyStan</a> interface for the statistical modeling platform Stan.
											The project was carried out during my fourth semester at the Technical Univeristy and uses a simple autoregressive mode, a state-space-model, and a state-space-model with inputs.</p>

											<h2>Hub Centric Bike Relocation</h2>
											<p><b><i>Optimising placement of bike sharing stations using machine learning </i></b></p>
											<p>The goal of the project was to give a recommendation as to how Donkey Republic could increase the utilization of their bikes. As donkey republic opreates a <a href="https://cities.donkey.bike/bike_share_hub-centric-model/">hub centric model</a>, the primary focus was on the placement of the many digital hubs. 
												The hubs are a way of controlling where bikes can be picked up and dropped off using virtual geo-fencing and a good placement of the hubs will allow Donkey Republic to meet the customers' demand for bikes in many places, while avoiding bike overflow and unmet demand. The project resulted in a presentation for Donkey Republic's C-suite, and a new position at the company to continue the work we started.</p>
